# JT BLOG

----

The Wordpress theme for JT's personal blog at https://jtiong.blog -- this is designed to match the styling and branding of https://jtiong.dev

## Code Style

ALL OVER THE PLACE. This is mainly because I write in PSR style code; but bloody Wordpress has their own weird way of doing things that honestly, make sense for Wordpress at least...

So, you get to enjoy a horrifying mashup of code styles everywhere. God speed!
